Connect Four
=
[**Connect Four**][0] is a simple game similar to [Tic-tac-toe][1] where if you *connect four tokens* of your color (red or yellow) **you win!**

In this case the game is *smooth and dark theme* which is quite relaxing to play.

**Connect Four** is played with 2 players (e.g. you and your friend) and it's a great compromise between the simplicity of [Tic-tac-toe][1] and the complexity of [Chess][2].
